This snakes and ladders game is primarily designed as a semester project. It particularly aims at imparting general workable and practical knowledge about C and lets the beginners have adequate concept on programming small to big projects. It is developed with a hope to increase the programming logic and also to provide substitution to the classical game “Snake and Ladder”.

Unlike other projects, there are many files, besides the source code files, that make up this snakes and ladders project in C. 
About Snakes and Ladders Game:

The game includes the facilities such as saving and loading the game. The saved games are password protected so that only the authorized user can load the previously saved game. The snakes and ladders game project comprises of multiple functions (scroll down to view the description for each) which can be dealt at ease. Attempt has been made to present the program in user friendly environment.
Objectives, Features and Scope:

OBJECTIVES

    To use different user defined function, to break a program into many simplified parts to deal with and to make it easier to understand the codes too.
    To promote the use of array in general programming for simplified version of the program.
    To apply the file handling concepts in order to retrieve the player’s data files that contains the data of the players.
    To use minimum graphics as far as possible to make the program execute fast but also user friendly side by side.
    To use general concept of c language to develop a simple snakes and ladders game that as a whole entertains the user.

FEATURES

    Compatible as multi-player game.
    Facility to save the game.
    Open the saved game using the password pre-defined by the user.
    Use minimum graphics in snakes and ladders as far as possible avoiding complex codes.

SCOPE

    Users preferring the classical games can switch to the game.
    Beginners in computer programming can take hints via the mini project to boost up their programming techniques.
    Can be brought in practice in training centers that offers basic programming courses.
    Can be the best choice as stress relieving game in the busy life pattern of the people in present life.
    Simplicity and efficient is main fact that we get using the c language, so user can execute snakes and ladders in each and every computer almost.
    Can be milestone for the programmers trying to learn to build projects in C.
